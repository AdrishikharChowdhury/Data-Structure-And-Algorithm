# Data Structures and Algorithms in C/C++

This repository contains a collection of C and C++ programs implementing various data structures and algorithms. These programs are designed for educational purposes and demonstrate fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Programs Included

1. **Array Operations**
   - File: `array delinsert func.c`
   - Description: Demonstrates array operations including insertion, deletion, and display using dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Linear Search**
   - File: `linear search dma.c`
   - Description: Implements linear search algorithm on a dynamically allocated array.

3. **Binary Search**
   - File: `binary search dma.c`
   - Description: Implements binary search algorithm on a sorted, dynamically allocated array.

4. **Modified Bubble Sort**
   - File: `Modified bubble sort.cpp`
   - Description: An optimized version of the bubble sort algorithm that stops early if the array is already sorted.

5. **Simple Insertion Sort**
   - File: `Simple Insertion sort.cpp`
   - Description: Implements the insertion sort algorithm for sorting an array.

6. **Interactive Insertion Sort**
   - File: `insertion sort.cpp`
   - Description: An interactive program that implements insertion sort with options for ascending and descending order sorting.

7. **Selection Sort**
   - File: `Selection sort method.cpp`
   - Description: Implements the selection sort algorithm with options for ascending and descending order sorting.

## Features

- Dynamic memory allocation for arrays
- Menu-driven interface for linked list operations
- Search algorithms: Linear and Binary search
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, and Selection sort
- Basic array operations: Insertion and deletion
- Interactive sorting with user-defined array size and sorting order
- Options for ascending and descending order in sorting algorithms

## How to Use

1. Compile the C/C++ files using a suitable compiler (e.g., gcc for C, g++ for C++).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts or menu options to interact with the programs.

## Compilation Examples

```bash
gcc linked_list_operations.c -o linked_list
gcc array_operations.c -o array_ops
gcc linear_search.c -o linear_search
gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search
g++ bubble_sort.cpp -o bubble_sort
g++ simple_insertion_sort.cpp -o simple_insertion_sort
g++ interactive_insertion_sort.cpp -o interactive_insertion_sort
g++ selection_sort.cpp -o selection_sort

## Note

These programs are intended for learning purposes and may not include extensive error handling or optimizations. They serve as a starting point for understanding basic data structures and algorithms in C and C++.
