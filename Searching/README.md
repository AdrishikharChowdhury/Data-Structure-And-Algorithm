# Searching

## Overview

Searching refers to the process of locating a specific element or value within a dataset. It is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science, used extensively in applications such as database querying, information retrieval, and routing.

## Searching Algorithms

### Common Searching Algorithms

1. **Linear Search**:
   - Checks each element of the dataset sequentially until the desired value is found.
   - **Time Complexity**: 
     - Best Case: \(O(1)\)
     - Average Case: \(O(n)\)
     - Worst Case: \(O(n)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
   - **Use Case**: Unsorted or small datasets.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Works on sorted datasets by dividing the search interval in half.
   - **Time Complexity**: 
     - Best Case: \(O(1)\)
     - Average Case: \(O(\log n)\)
     - Worst Case: \(O(\log n)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
   - **Use Case**: Efficient for large, sorted datasets.

3. **Jump Search**:
   - Skips a fixed number of elements at a time in a sorted array and then performs linear search within the smaller range.
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(\sqrt{n})\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
   - **Use Case**: Sorted datasets with a need for faster-than-linear search.

4. **Exponential Search**:
   - Locates the range where the target may exist and performs binary search in that range.
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
   - **Use Case**: Sorted datasets when the desired element is closer to the beginning.

5. **Interpolation Search**:
   - Improves binary search by estimating the probable position of the target based on its value.
   - **Time Complexity**: 
     - Best Case: \(O(\log \log n)\)
     - Worst Case: \(O(n)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
   - **Use Case**: Uniformly distributed, sorted datasets.

## Use Cases of Searching

- **Database Querying**: Locating specific records or entries in large datasets.
- **Pathfinding**: Finding optimal routes in graphs or networks.
- **Information Retrieval**: Used in search engines and recommendation systems.
- **Debugging**: Locating errors or specific patterns in code or logs.

## Example Code (General Pseudo-code)

### Linear Search
```plaintext
function linearSearch(array, target):
    for each element in array:
        if element == target:
            return index
    return -1
```

### Binary Search
```plaintext
function binarySearch(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = length(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        else if array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

### Searching Algorithms by Efficiency
| Algorithm           | Efficiency               |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Linear Search        | Inefficient for large datasets due to \(O(n)\) complexity. |
| Binary Search        | Efficient for sorted datasets with \(O(\log n)\) complexity. |
| Jump Search          | Faster than linear search but less efficient than binary search. |
| Exponential Search   | Ideal for datasets where the target is closer to the start. |
| Interpolation Search | Extremely efficient for uniformly distributed datasets. |
