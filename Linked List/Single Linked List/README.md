# Linked List Operations in C

This repository contains a C program that implements various operations on a **Singly Linked List**. The program provides a menu-driven interface, allowing users to interact with the linked list by performing a variety of operations, such as insertion, deletion, reversal, and sorting.

## What is a Singly Linked List?

A **Singly Linked List** is a dynamic data structure where each node contains:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Next pointer**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

It is particularly useful for applications where frequent insertions and deletions occur, as it does not require reallocating or reorganizing the entire structure.

## Features

This implementation includes the following functionalities:

- Create a linked list with a user-specified number of nodes.
- **Insert** nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position in the list.
- **Insert** a node after a given value.
- **Delete** nodes from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
- **Delete** a node with a specific value.
- **Reverse** the linked list.
- **Sort** the linked list in ascending order.
- **Display** the current state of the linked list.

## Functions

The program is structured into multiple functions, each designed to handle a specific operation on the singly linked list:

1. **`insertbeg`**: Insert a node at the beginning of the list.
2. **`insertend`**: Insert a node at the end of the list.
3. **`insertpos`**: Insert a node at a specific position.
4. **`insertval`**: Insert a node after a specified value.
5. **`delbeg`**: Delete the first node in the list.
6. **`delend`**: Delete the last node in the list.
7. **`delpos`**: Delete a node from a specific position.
8. **`delvalue`**: Delete a node with a specific value.
9. **`reverse`**: Reverse the linked list.
10. **`sortList`**: Sort the linked list in ascending order.
11. **`ShowList`**: Display the entire list.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to compile and run the program:

1. **Compile** the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
   ```

2. **Run** the compiled executable:
   ```bash
   ./linked_list
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to create an initial linked list, and then use the menu options to perform various operations on the list.

## Menu Options

Once the program is running, you can choose from the following menu options to interact with the linked list:

1. Insert At Beginning
2. Insert At End
3. Insert At Given Position
4. Insert After Given Value
5. Delete the First Node
6. Delete the Last Node
7. Delete Any Position
8. Delete Any Value
9. Reverse the Linked List
10. Count The No. Of Nodes (Note: Not implemented in the current version)
11. Sort the Linked List
12. Display The Linked List
13. Exit

## Example Usage

- **Insert at Beginning**: Add a new node to the start of the list.
- **Insert at End**: Append a node to the end of the list.
- **Insert at Given Position**: Insert a node at a user-specified position.
- **Delete by Value**: Remove a node that contains a specified value.
- **Reverse the List**: Reorder the nodes in reverse.

## Additional Notes

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: This implementation uses dynamic memory allocation (via `malloc`), so it is important to manage memory properly to avoid memory leaks.
- **Edge Cases**: The program is designed for educational purposes, and while it handles most typical use cases, it may not cover all edge cases or invalid inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling is implemented. For production-level code, adding input validation and memory management routines is recommended.
