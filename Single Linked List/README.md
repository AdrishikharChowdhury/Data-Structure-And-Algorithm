# Linked List Operations in C

This repository contains a C program that implements various operations on a singly linked list. The program offers a menu-driven interface for users to perform different actions on the linked list.

## Features

- Create a linked list with a user-specified number of nodes
- Insert nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position
- Insert a node after a given value
- Delete nodes from the beginning, end, or a specific position
- Delete a node with a specific value
- Reverse the linked list
- Sort the linked list
- Display the linked list

## Functions

The program includes the following main functions:

1. `insertbeg`: Insert a node at the beginning of the list
2. `insertend`: Insert a node at the end of the list
3. `insertpos`: Insert a node at a specific position
4. `insertval`: Insert a node after a given value
5. `delbeg`: Delete the first node
6. `delend`: Delete the last node
7. `delpos`: Delete a node at a specific position
8. `delvalue`: Delete a node with a specific value
9. `reverse`: Reverse the entire linked list
10. `countNodes`: Count the no. of nodes present in the Linked List
11. `sortList`: Sort the linked list in ascending order
12. `ShowList`: Display the current state of the linked list
13. `swapData`: Swap the data of consecutive two structure/node. Used for sorting
14. `menu`: The menu which contains all the operations for this Linked List in menu driven system and repeated it by using recursion

## How to Use

1. Compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., gcc)
2. Run the compiled executable
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to create an initial linked list
4. Use the menu options to perform various operations on the linked list

## Menu Options

1. Insert At Beginning
2. Insert At End
3. Insert At Given Position
4. Insert After Given Value
5. Delete the First Node
6. Delete the Last Node
7. Delete Any Position
8. Delete Any Value
9. Reverse the Linked List
10. Count The No. Of Nodes (not implemented in the current version)
11. Sort the Linked List
12. Display The Linked List
13. Exit

## Note

This program is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate basic linked list operations in C. It may not include error handling for all possible edge cases and inputs.
