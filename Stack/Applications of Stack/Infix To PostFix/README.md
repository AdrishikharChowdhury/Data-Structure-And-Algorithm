# Infix to Postfix Expression Converter

This project implements a program that converts an **infix** mathematical expression (e.g., `A + B * C`) into its equivalent **postfix** form (also known as **Reverse Polish Notation**, e.g., `ABC*+`). Postfix notation is useful for simplifying the evaluation of expressions in compilers and calculators.

## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Convert any valid infix expression into postfix notation.
- **Operator Support**: Handles common arithmetic operators:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Exponentiation (`^`)
- **Parentheses Handling**: Correctly manages expressions with parentheses to ensure proper operator precedence.
- **Precedence and Associativity**: Ensures that operators are applied in the correct order based on standard precedence rules.

## How It Works

The program uses a **stack** to handle operators and parentheses. The steps involved in converting an infix expression to postfix are as follows:

1. **Operands** (variables, numbers) are directly added to the output (postfix expression).
2. **Operators** are pushed onto the stack. When a new operator is encountered, the stack is checked to ensure that higher or equal precedence operators are applied first.
3. **Parentheses** ensure that sub-expressions are evaluated in the correct order. Once a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, operators are popped from the stack until the corresponding opening parenthesis `(` is found.
4. After processing the entire infix expression, any remaining operators on the stack are popped to form the complete postfix expression.

## Example

**Infix Expression:**
```
A + B * (C ^ D - E) ^ (F + G * H) - I
```

**Postfix Expression:**
```
ABCD^E- FGH*+ ^ * + I-
```

## Applications

- **Expression Evaluation**: Postfix notation simplifies the evaluation of complex expressions by eliminating the need for parentheses and respecting operator precedence.
- **Compilers and Interpreters**: Used in compiler design for parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions.
- **Calculators**: Postfix notation is often used in scientific calculators for efficient computation.
- **Algorithm Design**: Useful in stack-based algorithms, such as parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the code, you need:
- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC for C).

## Compilation

You can compile the C program using the following command:
```bash
gcc -o infix_to_postfix infix_to_postfix.c
```

## Usage

Once compiled, run the program and follow these steps:

1. **Enter the number of characters** in your infix expression (including operators and parentheses):
   ```
   Enter the number of terms: 9
   ```
   
2. **Input your infix expression**:
   ```
   Enter the infix expression: A+B*C
   ```
   
3. The program will display the equivalent postfix expression:
   ```
   The postfix expression is: ABC*+
   ```

### Example Run

**Input (Infix):**
```
(A + B) * C - D / E
```

**Output (Postfix):**
```
AB+ C * D E / -
```

## Code Overview

The core logic of the program includes several functions that handle the conversion:

- **`intopost()`**: Converts an infix expression to postfix using a stack for operator precedence.
- **`push()`**: Pushes an operator or parenthesis onto the stack.
- **`pop()`**: Pops the top element from the stack.
- **`precedence()`**: Determines the precedence level of an operator.
- **`isOperator()`**: Checks whether a character is a valid operator.

## Limitations

- **No Syntax Validation**: This program assumes that the input expression is valid. It doesn't check for issues like mismatched parentheses or invalid characters.
- **Single-character Operands**: The program is designed for single-character operands (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`). You would need to modify the code to support multi-digit numbers or variable names.
- **No Floating Point Support**: The program currently works with single characters and simple operators. Adding support for numbers and more complex operands would require additional handling.

## Enhancements

Future improvements could include:
- Support for multi-character variables or numbers.
- Error checking for invalid input expressions.
- Handling of spaces or formatting in the input expression.

### Generalization:
- The explanation and description focus on the **concept** of infix-to-postfix conversion, without being tied to any specific language or environment (although compilation instructions are still given for C).
- The usage section is generalized to reflect typical inputs and outputs, rather than specific programming details.
- Limitations and enhancement possibilities are outlined in broader terms, making the file more applicable to general implementations, not just the provided C code.
