Hereâ€™s a general **README.md** for a **Stack ADT** implementation. This can be used for any language or environment where you want to describe the implementation and usage of the stack abstract data type.

# Stack ADT (Abstract Data Type) Implementation

## Introduction

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. Elements are added to and removed from the **top** of the stack. The stack provides the following basic operations:

- **Push**: Adds an element to the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **isFull** (optional): Checks if the stack is full (if it has a maximum size).

## Features of the Stack ADT

1. **Push Operation**: Inserts an element at the top of the stack.
2. **Pop Operation**: Removes the topmost element from the stack and returns it.
3. **Peek Operation**: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks whether the stack is empty.
5. **isFull** (optional): Checks if the stack has reached its maximum capacity.

## Use Cases

- **Function Call Stack**: Used by most programming languages to manage function calls.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Evaluates expressions in postfix or infix notation.
- **Undo Mechanism**: Tracks the operations for undo functionality in applications.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: For example, in maze solvers and depth-first search.

## Operations

### 1. **Push**
```text
Push(value)
```
- Adds `value` to the stack.
- Throws an overflow exception if the stack is full (if applicable).

### 2. **Pop**
```text
Pop()
```
- Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- Throws an underflow exception if the stack is empty.

### 3. **Peek**
```text
Peek()
```
- Returns the top element without removing it.
- Throws an exception if the stack is empty.

### 4. **isEmpty**
```text
isEmpty()
```
- Returns `true` if the stack is empty; otherwise, returns `false`.

### 5. **isFull** (optional)
```text
isFull()
```
- Returns `true` if the stack is full (only applies for fixed-size stacks).

## Time Complexity
- **Push**: O(1)
- **Pop**: O(1)
- **Peek**: O(1)
- **isEmpty**: O(1)
- **isFull**: O(1) (only for fixed-size stacks)

## Space Complexity
- O(n), where **n** is the number of elements in the stack.

## Example

Here is an example of how a stack can be used (in pseudo-code):

```text
stack = new Stack(5)   // Create a stack with a capacity of 5 elements
stack.push(10)         // Push 10 to the stack
stack.push(20)         // Push 20 to the stack
stack.push(30)         // Push 30 to the stack

top_element = stack.peek()  // top_element will be 30
removed_element = stack.pop()  // removed_element will be 30

if stack.isEmpty()  // Returns false as the stack is not empty
    print("Stack is empty")
else
    print("Stack is not empty")
```

## Example Implementations

### 1. **C Implementation**
You can refer to the C implementation of a stack in the provided `stack.h` and `stack.c` files.

### 2. **Python Implementation**
The stack can be implemented using Python's **list** data structure or a custom class.

### 3. **Java Implementation**
The stack can be implemented using an **ArrayList** or a **LinkedList** in Java.

### 4. **C# Implementation**
A stack can be implemented using **List<T>** or **LinkedList<T>** in C#.

## Conclusion

The **Stack ADT** is a simple yet powerful data structure with multiple applications in algorithms, function calls, undo operations, and more. It is easy to implement and efficient to use for tasks that require LIFO ordering of elements.
